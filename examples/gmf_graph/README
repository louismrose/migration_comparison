Resources for an example of the evolution of the GMF Graph metamodel.

This folder contains:

Before.ecore: the GMF Graph metamodel from GMF v1.x
After.ecore:  the GMF Graph metamodel from GMF v2.0

The models folder contains exemplar GMF Graph models. In each subfolder, Before.model conforms to Before.ecore while After.gmfgraph conforms to After.ecore. After.gmfgraph has been generated by running GMF's built-in migrator on Before.model.

models/mindmap and models/taipan are taken from the examples directory of GMF source code repository.
